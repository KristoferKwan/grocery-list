# Grocery List

### Overview
In light of Covid-19, I have had to cook for myself on a more frequent basis. As such, it has become imperitive for me to periodically stock my fridge with fresh ingredients. Usually, I tend to write these ingredients down on a piece of paper or the notes app on my phone. However writing into the notes app does not allow me to easily cross any of the ingredients off of my list. A hand-written list can be cumbersome to modify while going through the grocery store (and hard to read due to my poor handwriting haha). As such, given the suggested time constraint of this assignment and my afformentioned painpoint, I have created `Grocery List`: a simple, intuitive way of keeping track of your groceries on any device.
